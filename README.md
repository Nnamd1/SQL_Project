# SQL_Project

## Hi there! My name is Nnamdi Leonard and you are welcome to view this project. Enjoy! 

## Introduction
This project depicts knowledge in the use of the structural query language (SQL) with the use of an SQL Server Reporting Service (SSRS)). It intends to show how I correctly translate enquiries and instructions from the team lead/manager (who for the sake of this project, we'll call Sam) into SQL statements in order to retrieve the desired data. These enquiries are broken into tasks and then segmented according to area of request.
